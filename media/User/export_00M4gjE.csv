With the Basaltex Mutliaxial construction Tecnifibre has aimed to improve the feel and touch of the racket ,we however did not notice any major change while playing unless you are really into the details.  It does however minimize vibrations which we noticed crept into it's predecessor after long use.  The racket comes pre loaded with the Tecnifibre 305+ 1.20mm black string which is a bit tough getting used , slightly thinner than the Tecnifibre 305 and slightly more stiffer making the wear slower than the 305's. Overall, we really think this is one of the best balanced rackets in the market."" The Tecnifibre Carboflex 130 squash racquet is a multiaxial frame that weighs 130 grams.  It has a slightly head heavy balance and a large head at 500 cm2 with long main strings. It comes prestrung with Tecnifibres new 305+ 1.20mm Black string. Youd fine it really easy to swing as it is light enough to be quick on the volley and gives you the pace on your choicest drives at the same time due to the head heavy balance. Especially, youd love the feel on contact with this racket as Technifibre has definitely designed this model to improve feel and responsiveness. The Tecnifibre 305+ 1.20mm black squash cross string it is strung with, totally jells-well with this frame.
